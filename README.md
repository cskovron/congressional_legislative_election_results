**congressional_legislative_election_results**

These are cleaned CSV files of Clinton and Trump vote share by congressional and legislative district using data compiled by the [Daily Kos](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/2/6/1629653/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2016-presidential-results-for-congressional-and-legislative-districts "Daily Kos Election Data"). 
I link every district to UNIQUEID to make it easier to merge to other datasets (e.g., Census files).
